PII, non-PII, and personal data are terms related to data privacy and refer to different types of information:

PII (Personally Identifiable Information):
PII is any data that can be used to identify, contact, or locate an individual. This information is sensitive and typically includes:

Full name
Social Security number
Driver's license number
Passport number
Address
Email address
Phone number
Financial information (e.g., bank account numbers, credit card numbers)
Medical information
Biometric data (e.g., fingerprints, facial recognition data)
PII is subject to strict data protection and privacy regulations to ensure that it is handled and secured appropriately.

Non-PII (Non-Personally Identifiable Information):
Non-PII, as the name suggests, is data that cannot be used to identify an individual directly. This type of information is not sensitive in nature and typically includes generic data like:

Demographic information (e.g., age, gender, race)
Behavioral data (e.g., website browsing history)
User preferences (e.g., favorite color)
Aggregated statistics (e.g., total website visits)
Non-PII is less regulated than PII and is used for various analytical and marketing purposes.

Personal Data:
Personal data is a broader term that encompasses both PII and non-PII. It refers to any information related to an identified or identifiable individual, whether the data can directly identify a person or not. This includes all types of information that are associated with a person, both sensitive and non-sensitive.
